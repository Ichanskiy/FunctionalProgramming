/**
 * 2.35 Custom integer reducer
 * Write three operators:
 * <p>
 * A reduce operator that accepts an initial value (seed) and a combiner function and then returns a new function that combines all values in the given integer range (inclusively) into one integer value (it's a simple form of reduction).
 * In terms of the reduce operator define a sum operator for summing integer values in the given range.
 * In terms of the reduce operator define a product operator for multiplying integer values in the given range.
 * Try not to use Stream API. Write the reducer yourself.
 * <p>
 * To simplify the problem all functions are declared, you need to finish their realization.
 * Look carefully at definition of each operator.
 * <p>
 * During testing all three operators will be tested. The left boundary <= the right boundary.
 * <p>
 * Example 1. Left boundary = 1, right boundary = 4.
 * sumOperator returns the result 10.
 * productOperator returns the result 24.
 * Example 2. Left boundary = 5, right boundary = 6.
 * sumOperator returns the result 11.
 * productOperator returns the result 30.
